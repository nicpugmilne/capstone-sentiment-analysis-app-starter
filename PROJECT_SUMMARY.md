# SentimentScope - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

SentimentScope is a comprehensive sentiment analysis application that provides businesses with tools to measure and understand customer sentiment from feedback and reviews. The application serves as a prototype allowing clients to test different sentiment analysis models with their own inputs.

## ✅ User Stories Completed

### US-01: Implement VADER in the App ✅

- **Implementation**: Integrated VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer
- **Features**:
  - Positive, negative, neutral, and compound sentiment scores
  - Percentage-based display of sentiment components
  - Real-time analysis of user input text

### US-02: Build a Custom Keras Model ✅

- **Implementation**: Created and trained a custom sentiment analysis model using the UCI Labelled Sentences dataset
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Embedding layer (2000 features, 64 dimensions)
  - LSTM layer (16 units)
  - Dense layer with sigmoid activation
- **Training Data**: 2,748 samples from Yelp, Amazon, and IMDB datasets
- **Performance**: 79.7% accuracy on test set
- **Files Created**:
  - `notebooks/UCI_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` - Training notebook
  - `models/uci_sentimentanalysis.h5` - Trained model
  - `models/tokenizer.pickle` - Text tokenizer

### US-03: Test your model ✅

- **Implementation**: Comprehensive testing of the custom model
- **Test Results**: Model correctly classifies positive and negative sentiments
- **Sample Test Cases**: Verified with various input types and sentiment intensities

### US-04: Integrate the model and tokenizer in your application ✅

- **Implementation**: Seamless integration of custom model with Flask application
- **Features**:
  - Automatic model and tokenizer loading on app startup
  - Real-time sentiment prediction
  - Side-by-side comparison with VADER results

### US-05: Improve the UI ✅

- **Implementation**: Modern, responsive user interface design
- **Features**:
  - Clean, professional design with gradient background
  - Responsive grid layout for sentiment scores
  - Color-coded sentiment indicators
  - Hover effects and smooth transitions
  - Separate sections for VADER and custom model results

### US-06: Deployment ✅

- **Implementation**: Application ready for deployment on Render
- **Configuration**:
  - Build command: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start command: `gunicorn app:app`
  - Environment variable: `PYTHON_VERSION=3.10.12`

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)

- **Framework**: Flask 2.2.5
- **Models**:
  - VADER Sentiment Analyzer
  - Custom Keras LSTM model
- **Dependencies**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, pandas

### Frontend

- **Template Engine**: Jinja2
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design principles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

### Model Performance

- **VADER**: Rule-based sentiment analysis, excellent for social media text
- **Custom Model**: 79.7% accuracy, trained on diverse dataset
- **Combined Approach**: Provides comprehensive sentiment analysis
